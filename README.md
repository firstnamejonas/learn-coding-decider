# [LEARN CODING DECIDER](https://firstnamejonas.github.io/learn-coding-decider)

Welcome to Learn Coding Decider, a web application designed to help you answer the common question: "Is Coding for me?" 
The heart of the site is the Decider, an interactive decision tree that guides users through a series of questions to help them determine if pursuing programming as a future career path is the right choice. The ultimate goal is to encourage users to sign up for a newsletter, fostering a connection for ongoing guidance and support.

## UX

Crafting a compelling User Experience (UX) is pivotal in shaping and implementing the 'learn-coding-decider' website. Beyond merely disseminating information about the project, my objective is to establish an interactive and user-friendly environment that motivates visitors to actively engage with the initiative. The UX design process has been meticulously developed to enable seamless navigation, ensuring users comprehend the mission of 'Learn Coding Decider' and are ultimately inspired to find their right career path.
The process encompasses:
* Understanding the audience's informational needs and interests as the foundation for a strategically designed interface.
* Organizing the website structure for intuitive access to information, facilitating effortless navigation through its various sections.
* Designing a visually appealing layout that conveys key messages and the mission behind 'Learn Coding Decider' promptly.

### Colour Scheme

- #212120 and white are used for texts.
- #212120 is used for main background of the page
- #ebae4a is used for highlights of the page

I used these colors because they not only contrast well with each other, but also because they convey a technical flair.

### Typography

- 'Courier New‘, with a backfall font of Courier and Monospace, was used for all text on the page.
- I used this font because it looks like the font you use in IDE's when programming.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used, such as the social media icons in the footer.
